# ansi-regex

Fork of [ansi-regex](https://github.com/chalk/ansi-regex) with making it useful for testing other implementations of ansi-escape detection.

- test cases and fixtures are exported so they can be used by other projects that need to validate their ansi escape code behavior
- improved test suite
- written in Civet for improved clarity
- CJS and ESM support

Version number tracks https://github.com/chalk/ansi-regex
